# Design & Develop

Before the next class on Thursday, we need you to organize your Google Drive folders and update them according to our reviews. 
Each group should upload:

- flowboard / scene map / game flow: check class' github page for examples
- download and work on the latest version of the p5GameTemplate: very important! we can't help you unless you synchronize yourselves with us
- the game: (naming: gameName_v00x.zip) please be careful about versioning
- paper prototype/gameplay video 
- presentation: keep it updated and keep versioning
- GDD: keep it updated and keep versioning

We can't help you and won't give a review, if your project doesn't meet the requirements next class..

This project requires your efforts on both Design (game design, visual design, UI design, interaction design) and Development (p5 game sketch, interaction development). Please divide your work in the group on these subjects properly.
