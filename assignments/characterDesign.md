# Character Design

## Describe the core characteristics of your character with at least the following
1. BiographÄ±cal (if relevant as: name, age, height...)
2. Behaviours (Attitude and Affordances)
3. Role (in the game world, in relation to the player)

## Develop a series of sketches that illustrate the character
- artbook and out-game aesthetics (often the character illustrated out-game is different than how it looks in game eg. in a pixel based game the character is illustrated with high fidelity drawing on game cover and menus or out-game animations)
- in-game aesthetics
