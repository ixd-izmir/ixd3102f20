# Research
Choose a videogame that cannot be completed in less than 15min (it can be a new game or something you played in the past).

Play the chosen game for 15mins.

## During the game:
1. keep tracks of the visual elements (characters, props, environments, ui elements...).
2. record dialogues or other narrative elements (voice-over, in-game text...)
3. take screenshots of memorable moments.

## After the game:
1. collect metadata (title, year of release, producers, design team and size of production team)
2. describe the game in max three sentences (do X without causing Y)

Organize the lists of visual and narrative elements, the screenshots and the metadata in one (or more of needed) vertical A4. DESIGN the A4 as if it was your own project presentation.

- The size of type for text can be around 8pt for a comfortable reading.
- Don't use multiple pages if not needed
