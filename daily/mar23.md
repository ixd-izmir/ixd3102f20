# Regroup, Review, Restart
Dear students, the subject of this class is to restart with our education reconsidering the actual condition.

The first task is to "regroup" meaning set our tools to "be together" in the time of social distancing.

As announced on Sakai before, today, we will try some of this tools and eventually changed them in case of failure.
We need to try and make errors, to make better mistakes tomorrow.
