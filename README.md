## Description
This course introduces the concept and practice of physical computing and applies through a game design perspective.

The aim is to design and prototype physical intefaces for interaction using the widespread electronic prototyping platforms (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi).

The final outcome will consist in a design proposal for an installation in a museum of Izmir.

The contribution of external professionals and academicians will help to clarify the complexity of the work and the involved stakeholder.

## Outcomes
1. Develop techniques and theories to make interactive physical artifacts
2. Apply methodologies and theories to the design practice
3. Learn to structure project planning for a physical interactive device
4. Prepare professional solutions to wicked (design) problems
5. Improve social skills while collaborating in small groups
6. Develop unique design approaches individually

The best way to document the game's structure is with a flowboard. The word is a combination of "flowchart" and "storyboard." Like a storyboard, it consists of a number of pictures, but unlike a film storyboard, it's not a linear series. Rather, each picture is a sketch, or mockup, of the screen in one particular gameplay mode. Under the picture is the mode's name and a brief description of its perspective, interaction model, challenges, and actions. Connecting the pictures together are arrows showing how the modes switch from one to the next, with a text notation to indicate when and why the transition takes place.
