## Description
This course introduces the concept and practice of physical computing and applies through a game design perspective.

The aim is to design and prototype physical intefaces for interaction using the widespread electronic prototyping platforms (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi).

The final outcome will consist in a design proposal for an installation in a museum of Izmir.

The contribution of external professionals and academicians will help to clarify the complexity of the work and the involved stakeholder.

## Outcomes
1. Develop techniques and theories to make interactive physical artifacts
2. Apply methodologies and theories to the design practice
3. Learn to structure project planning for a physical interactive device
4. Prepare professional solutions to wicked (design) problems
5. Improve social skills while collaborating in small groups
6. Develop unique design approaches individually
